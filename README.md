<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The name of the project is “Study Tracker” and the purpose of this app is to monitor the study time of the students using the camera of the device. The project will be available as an android app (main goal) and as a website (future work). This app will be able to recognize the user and identify the amount of time he/she has spent on a particular material. </p>
<p>Study Tracker is designed to use both the face recognition API and eye tracking API to confirm whether a reader is actually reading or not. The idea is based on Google Classroom. Through the Study Tracker, any user can create a classroom and upload materials. Students, in this classroom, can access and read the materials using this app or the website. Additionally, their facial information will be tracked to recognize and verify whether he/she is the actual user. Their eyes will also be tracked while reading the materials. Inside a class, the creator can monitor the reading time of the students and the amount of time a material is read. Furthermore, if the creator wants, they can view the statistics of the individual students in the class.</p>

 <h2 id="technology">3. Technology</h2>
 <h3>3.1 Implemented Technology: </h3>
<p>We decided to go with latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front end we will be using Android with Java and XML. XML and Android programming will be used to create user interface.</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>This application uses an eye tracking API and a facial recognition API which uses smartphone camera for eye tracking and facial recognition.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>We will be using Firebase to handle our entire database.</p>
<p><em>Additional Information</em></p>
<p>Firebase will also be used to for the user authentication.</p>
<p>The app can run on android devices which have version 5.0 (Lollipop)or more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="monetization">4. Monetization</h2>
<p>We will try to make our product subscription based and sell it to different schools and colleges. As the young people need constant monitoring on their studies, they make the perfect audience for our product.</p>
<p>Educational institutes can also place their ads on the website after it is launched, which will help them advertise themselves to the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project would be beneficial for the teachers who want to monitor their students. The teacher will be able to check in the students whether they are studying properly or not, and it is also easy to track their progress.</p>
